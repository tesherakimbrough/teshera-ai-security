## About Me

I'm a self-driven Security Builder transitioning from IAM/GRC and Help Desk into AI & Cybersecurity Engineering. I create privacy-first tools that blend automation, clean code, and user trust.

Let's build meaningful technology together — grounded in privacy, ethics, and usable security.
